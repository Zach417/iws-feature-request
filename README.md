# iws-feature-request
A simple tool for Intuitive Web Solutions team members to record features requested by clients. Application is up at http://54.191.112.74/

## About the app
The technology stack of this app is React.js, Node.js, and MongoDB. This stack makes it so that almost 100% of the codebase is in JavaScript. The front-end architecture takes advantage of React's one-way data flow model by utilizing a dispatcher to close the loop between actions and data stores.

## Running the app in 20 easy steps
If you want to load the app onto a blank ec2, below is the set of commands for getting this web app running on an ec2 with Amazon Linux AMI 2016.03.0. I usually have issues getting MongoDB off the ground, so if you get an error when you execute #14, I would just recommend that you yum remove mongodb-org, yum autoremove the dependencies, and retry the installation. Double check you're installing MongoDB 2.6 as well.
#### Basics
	1.	sudo yum update
	2.	sudo yum install gcc-c++ make
	3.	sudo yum install openssl-devel
	4.	sudo yum install git
#### Installing node
	5.	wget https://nodejs.org/dist/v4.4.3/node-v4.4.3.tar.gz
	6.	tar -xvf node-v4.4.3.tar.gz
	7.	cd node-v4.4.3
	8.	./configure && make && sudo make install
#### Cloning repo
	9.	cd /home/ec2-user/
	10.	git clone https://github.com/Zach417/iws-feature-request
#### Installing MongoDB
	11.	cd /etc/yum.repos.d/
	12.	sudo nano mongodb-org-2.6.repo
	‚ÅÉ	[[mongodb-org-2.6] name=MongoDB 2.6 Repository baseurl=http://downloads-distro.mongodb.org/repo/redhat/os/x86_64/ gpgcheck=0 enabled=1
	13.	sudo yum install -y mongodb-org
	14.	sudo service mongod start
#### Installing NPM packages and linking node for sudo commands
	15.	cd /home/ec2-user/iws-feature-request/
	16.	npm i
	17.	sudo ln -s /usr/local/bin/node /usr/bin/node
	18.	sudo ln -s /usr/local/lib/node /usr/lib/node
	19.	sudo ln -s /usr/local/bin/npm /usr/bin/npm
#### Starting the app
	20.	sudo npm start

## Other notes
All of the front-end javascript is compiled/minified to make it faster across the wire, so if you want to make changes to the code, you'll have to "npm run build" to compile the code, which is a link to a script called "build" in the project's package.json.
